# 28days-of-technical-writing

Hello all, welcome to **28days of technical writing mini cohort** ü§ù

This is an initiative for empowering non-code open source contributions and practising technical writing with the agenda of writing one blog per week consistently for 28 days. This would mean that for next one month (or maybe more if you pursue to be part of community for longer period of time) people would be participating to write four blogs over a period of month. Every week, on wednesday we have a community call scheduled for showcase and experience.

If you are up for this challenge, then you can fork this repo and edit the Begin-Journey.md(https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/28days-of-technical-writing/blob/main/begin-journey.md) and start adding your details!
