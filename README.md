# 28days-of-technical-writing

Hello all, welcome to **28days of technical writing mini cohort** ü§ù

This is an initiative for empowering non-code open source contributions and practising technical writing with the agenda of writing one blog per week consistently for 28 days. This would mean that for next one month (or maybe more if you pursue to be part of community for longer period of time) people would be participating to write four blogs over a period of month. Every week, on wednesday we have a community call scheduled for showcase and experience.You can pick the choice of your topic, both in web2 and web3 domain are allowed.


If you are up for this challenge, then you can fork this repo and edit the [begin-journey.md](https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/28days-of-technical-writing/blob/main/begin-journey.md) and start adding your details!

Also, don't forget to **create a PR** for adding your name to this list of participants, so that we can add you to our contributor list !
